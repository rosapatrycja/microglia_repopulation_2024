Microglia (MG) are resident myeloid cells in the central nervous system (CNS) that perform homeostatic or pathological functions. 
Microglia self-renewal is controlled by the macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1). 
Inhibitors of CSF-1 receptor (i.a. BLZ-945) by blocking the CSF1R signaling deplete 99% of microglia in 21 days and after cessation of treatment microglia rapidly repopulate and restore normal density within 1 week in adult mice. 
The functions of these repopulated microglia are poorly known and they can vary according to age. 
To investigate the microglia repopulation process, we compared BLZ-945 depleted microglia from young (3 months) and old (12 months) GFP-M::Cx3cr1-CreERT2fl/fl::Rosa26-tdTomatotg/tg mice against undepleted controls using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). 
Four scRNA-seq libraries (Rep1 to Rep4) were constructed, each combining four animals representing all experimental conditions (control young, control old, repopulated young, repopulated old).
